# üîÑ Proxmox VE ‚Äî Restore a Deleted VM from an Orphaned QCOW2 Disk

When the VM definition (`<vmid>.conf`) is gone but the disk image is still
present on a **directory/NFS storage**, you can rebuild the guest in minutes.

This repository contains:

* **`scripts/rebuild-vm.sh`** ‚Äì an interactive Bash script that  
  1. Prompts for basic VM settings and storage paths  
  2. Re-creates a VM shell (UEFI/Q35)  
  3. Attaches the rescued QCOW2 as a SATA drive for the first boot  
  4. Mounts the VirtIO driver ISO  
  5. Prints follow-up commands to switch the disk to VirtIO-SCSI

* **This `README.md`** ‚Äì background, prerequisites, step-by-step usage,
  and a post-restore checklist.

> **Example scenario:** Windows Server 2022 guest, stored on an NFS share called
> `proxmox-storage`, VMID 610, disk file
> `images/610/vm-610-disk-0.qcow2`.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Background

| Fact | Why it matters |
|------|----------------|
| Directory/NFS storage keeps each disk as a standalone `qcow2` file. | You can ‚Äúre-attach‚Äù it just by naming the file path. |
| Windows boots from **SATA** without extra drivers. | We attach as SATA first to avoid an *INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE* BSOD. |
| VirtIO offers the best performance. | After drivers are installed, we swap the disk to VirtIO-SCSI. |

## ‚úÖ  Prerequisites

| Item | Example |
|------|---------|
| QCOW2 image | `/mnt/pve/proxmox-storage/images/610/vm-610-disk-0.qcow2` |
| VirtIO driver ISO | `proxmox-storage:iso/virtio-win.iso` |
| Free VMID | `610` (use the original if possible) |
| Proxmox shell access | Run as **root** on any node that sees the storage |
